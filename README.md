This repository contains all the materials used in the second chapter of my thesis. 
These tools are designed to extract Wikipedia texts in simple and complex versions.
Then use them to build a text classification tool to distinguish between simple and complex texts. 
It includes a file for extraction, a file for transforming texts into vectors, and a file for training the classification model.
